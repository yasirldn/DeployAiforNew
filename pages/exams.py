Refer to the Individual Exam Arrangements page for details.\n\n- If you are entitled to additional time for an on-site exam, this is already included in online assessments with a 24-hour submission window.\n- If your exam is a shorter time-limited assessment, you will be advised of any additional time allowed.\n- If you require a scribe/amanuensis, Disability Learning Services (DLS) will ensure assistive technology is available to support you.",

This means if you attend the exam, you are considered fit to do so and cannot later submit a mitigating circumstances claim for that assessment.",
    
    "Why do I have two exams in one day?": "Due to the large number of exams scheduled in a short timeframe, some students may have two exams in one day. However, you would not normally be expected to sit more than two exams in a single day."
